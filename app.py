    Potholes are a common issue on roads worldwide, caused by factors such as weather changes, heavy traffic, and poor maintenance. They not only lead to
    discomfort for drivers and passengers but also pose serious safety risks, potentially causing accidents or vehicle damage. In contrast, plain or undamaged
    roads provide a smooth and safe driving experience. Being able to accurately distinguish between potholes and plain road surfaces is crucial for modern
    infrastructure monitoring. Developing a model that can automatically classify road conditions from images helps in early detection and timely repair of potholes.
    This kind of automated system can support road maintenance efforts, reduce manual inspection time, improve road safety, and optimize resource allocation for repairs.

    In this app, I've trained and deployed a model that's able to classify between plain road images and pothole images. Feel free to try the model out through the
